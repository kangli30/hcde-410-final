 According to study, Democrats tend to favor vaccines over time, while Republicans tend to disfavor vaccines over time. In my research, I will find if there are notable difference in willingness to vaccinate between Democrat and Republican states to see if people from a political party tend to favor vaccination. I have used US vaccination data, US state population data, and US 2020 election data to find the average percentage of people willing to vaccinate in Democrat and Republican states. My analysis shows that in Democrat states, 5% of the population are more willing to vaccinate compared to Republican states on average.
